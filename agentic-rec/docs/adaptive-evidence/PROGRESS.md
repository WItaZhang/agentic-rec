# Research execution checkpoint

Last updated: 2026-09-23 UTC. The full research goal remains active.

## Authorization and resources

- Branch: `codex/adaptive-evidence-research`; repository default:
  `claude/agentic-recommendation-survey-9afqks`.
- Paid API authorization updated by user: **USD 50 total**, estimate each round.
  First smoke round cap USD 1; campaign planning stop USD 45. No cloud rental.
  Persistent ledger: `logs/budget/openai_ledger.jsonl`; uncertain calls retain
  maximum reservations. Request a popup before exceeding the total authorization.
- Available local hardware: Ryzen 7 5800H (8 cores / 16 threads), 14.89 GB RAM,
  AMD integrated graphics; no CUDA GPU detected. CPU experiments are the default.
- Cached real model: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`, revision
  `989aa7980e4cf806f80c7fef2b1adb7bc71aa306`, including 3.09 GB weights.
  Availability is verified; inference feasibility and quality are not yet verified.
- User supplied a local OpenAI credential file, excluded via `.git/info/exclude`.
  Credential authentication verified through the unbilled model-list endpoint.
  Never copy credentials into configs, reports, tool output or Git.

## Initial audit

- Default branch at `1cacbc738529499a6c979d4f52f0dd0c4254e71d`: reference
  framework and eight adaptive-evidence design documents; all eight read.
- PR [#1](https://github.com/WItaZhang/agentic-rec/pull/1) is open, not merged,
  has no reviews/comments, and its Python 3.11/3.12 CI passed.
- Preserved its original commits `965081d` and `ad35806` by merging its branch
  into this task's branch. The existing PR was not rewritten or merged remotely.
- Fresh isolated clone; no other person's uncommitted project work was touched.

## Milestones

| Stage | Status | Implementation / evidence | Finding / next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 audit and reproduction | validated | Original `ad35806`; local runs `logs/20260923_231823_ml100k_popularity` and `logs/20260923_231847_ml100k_popularity` | Both reproduce original metrics; 42 tests and Ruff pass. Preserve fixed-history, multi-positive protocol as `ml100k_fixed_history_multipositive_v0`. |
| M1a conventional models | validated | `ccd702a`; `logs/20260923_232152_ml100k_baselines`; [report](../../reports/20260923_m1a_baselines/README.md) | NDCG difference +0.000145, 95% CI [-0.008999, +0.008047]; no established gain, Recall lower. No test-based retuning. |
| M1b Amazon coverage | validated | `34cdb4e`; `logs/20260923_232442_amazon_training_profile`; `configs/amazon_profile.yaml` | Magazine selected using training-only coverage and memory. Digital Music retained as rejected candidate. |
| M1c event replay | validated | `a20628e`; `logs/20260923_232911_amazon_magazine_replay`; [report](../../reports/20260923_m1c_amazon_replay/README.md) | Validation CandidateRecall@50=0.373081; improve/expand retrieval before LLM scale-up. Test unscored. |
| M1d sequence baseline | validated | `45be0c3`; `logs/20260923_233625_amazon_magazine_sequence`; [report](../../reports/20260923_m1d_sequence/README.md) | Sequence validation NDCG 0.067832; retrieval no better. Freeze ItemKNN top-200 for main evidence comparisons. |
| M2 real LLM | implementing | `configs/amazon_llm_smoke.yaml`, OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini snapshot | First real round: 8 development requests, 32 calls, upper USD 0.425; no effectiveness claim from smoke. |
| M3–M4 evidence and routing | planned | Conditional on usable evidence variation | Keep fixed, rule and random controls; no obligation to retain a failed complex method. |
| M5 sequential evidence | conditional | No implementation claimed | Only pursue if observations after fetching evidence can improve a decision. |
| M6 report and career materials | planned | Claim ledger tied to completed results | Strong baseline, statistics, ablations, limitations and honest LaTeX. |

Current work: durable paid-call accounting, target-free R1–R4 evidence, real API
smoke, then a development sample sized using variance and measured costs.
`configs/amazon_llm_smoke.yaml` fixes all settings and prices; prompts are versioned.
The local float32 adapter remains implemented but unexecuted (only about 1.9 GB
RAM free at inspection). No cloud resource, quantized model, or runtime was rented.
No external input is pending. Paid spending before first smoke: USD 0.

## Decisions and limitations

- The user's full-route authorization supersedes the design's instruction to stop
  after one milestone. Changes remain small and independently reviewable.
- M0 test NDCG@10 = 0.25981395087250847, Recall@10 = 0.07377170290648945.
  These are **multi-positive window** metrics, not next-item metrics.
- 235/315 test users have no training history; 454 cold-item positives remain
  misses. This substantially limits what personalization can improve in v0.
- The original input SHA-256 matches the official file; all 100,000 rows used.
- The existing reference framework's mutable candidate tools and character
  counters are unsuitable for claims about fixed-candidate/token-cost research.
- Amazon choice: Magazine has 2,939 training items and 74.8% category coverage;
  Digital Music has 47,203 items and 0.013% category coverage. Magazine's richer
  categories and lower memory cost support the first attribute experiment.
  Neither has substantial `features` coverage. Magazine has only 268 training
  users with at least five events: long-history conclusions will be limited.
- Raw Amazon files were fully downloaded from the official McAuley Lab URLs.
  Exact-record deduplication removed 575 Magazine and 1,670 Digital Music rows.
  No user k-core was applied, and no cold requests will be silently excluded.
- Freeze first Amazon block ends: 2018 / 2020 / 2021 / 2023-09-10 UTC;
  base-model inner validation begins 2016. Chosen from date/coverage profiles,
  before any ranking evaluation for these blocks. The final test is not scored
  during development. Config: `configs/amazon_magazine_replay.yaml`.
- M1a CPU wall 8.31 s; Amazon profiling wall 7.96 s. No paid services used.

## Resume commands

Run from the inner `agentic-rec/` project directory. Inspect this file and
`git status` before resuming; do not rerun final tests to tune against results.

```sh
uv sync --locked --extra yaml --extra experiments
uv run --locked --extra yaml --extra experiments python -m pytest
uv run --locked --extra yaml --extra experiments ruff check .
```

Local raw data, full predictions, models and logs remain git-ignored. Publish
only aggregate evidence and reproducible configurations, with dataset attribution.
